            <header>In 1888, the Revered Johannes Fiedler began work on what he considered his life's greatest accomplishment, an opera that he hoped would meld Martian and Terran musical traditions with the goal of bringing both cultures closer together in the process.</header>

            <p>For his subject, he chose the ancient Martian legend, "The Sorrow of Liyaan and Pootral", about a pair of lovers who tear their families apart in pursuit of an unacceptable relationship. In the original version, the emphasis was on the selfishness of the lovers, and how it destroyed their families. For Fiedler's version, he took a decidedly more sympathetic approach, borrowing heavily from the Terran play Romeo and Juliet. He also made one additional alteration, in the spirit of Martian / Terran unity: in his version of the story, "Liyaan" is actually "Lena", a young woman from Earth.</p>

            </aside>
            This change, which he believed was relatively minor, had profound implications for the opera, for Fiedler's own life, and for the very fabric of society, both Terran and Martian. Unfortunately, traditional Martian culture did not view cross-cultural romance as a mere prohibition, the way Fiedler depicted it in his work.</p>
            <p>
            In actuality, in traditional Martian culture it was a horrific taboo, on par with incest or bestiality. When the opera premiered, as a chamber piece at the Countess of Danforth's monthly salon, Rev. Fielder managed to conclude roughly half of his prepared introductory remarks before being universally denounced. Gasps filled the audience and chairs were overturned as the Martian leadership stormed out of the room in disgust, followed quickly be the most powerful Terrans in attendance (including Fieldler's influential patrons, the von Sachsen family).

            <p>
                Fiedler, crushed and bewildered, was ultimately convinced to finish the opera by his friends Philomena Geyer and Jean-Jaque du Sice. Fronting the production costs, they enabled the opera to be staged at the Theatre Communard, in Paris, where word of the scandalous nature of the production created such a demand for tickets that it played to standing-room houses for the first year of its run. This not only ensured the fortune of Reverend Fiedler, but it also provided one of the first public opportunities for open discussion about human / Martian relationships.

                The following performance is from an early workshopped version of Lena's grand aria in Act III, where she boldly declares that, even though she is not a Martian, her love of Pootral is such that she has come to love his planet as well. It takes place the night after the airship fight, in which she is almost devoured by a Sky Squid.

            <p>Pootral, my heart delights in you.</p>
            <p>The star over the Martian mountains</p>
            <p>Is not brighter than all my love for you.</p>
            <p>Pootral, this world is not my home.</p>
            <p>The plains, canals and Martian mountains</p>
            <p>Are strange to me and yet my love for you,</p>
            <p>Pootral, makes me delight in it. </p>
            <p>I will embrace the Martian mountains,</p>
            <p>I will trade my home for the love of you.</p>
